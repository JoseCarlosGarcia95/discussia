# Discussia

Discussia is a tool that generates debates based on a given topic. It simulates a discussion between two or more people, each with a different opinion on the topic, and allows them to argue their points of view.

At the end, the tool generates a summary of the debate.

## Getting Started with Discussia (Docker)

1. Run the following command to start the Discussia container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/josecarlosgarcia95/discussia:main
   ```

2. Once the container is running, you can start a debate.
